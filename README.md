# Autonomous Car

An autonomous car project built with Arduino Uno, servo motor, ultrasonic sensors, L293D motor driver, gear motors, two 9V batteries, and jumper wires.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build an autonomous car using Arduino Uno. The car is capable of navigating its environment using ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and a servo motor to control the direction of the ultrasonic sensor.

## Installation
*Install the necessary libraries for Arduino:
    - NewPing library for ultrasonic sensors.
    - Servo library for controlling the servo motor.
    - MotorDriver library for L293D motor driver.

## Hardware Components

- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller used to control the car.
- **Servo Motor**: Mounted with the ultrasonic sensor to project it in different directions.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Detect obstacles in the car's path.
- **L293D Motor Driver**: Drives the gear motors.
- **Gear Motors**: Provide movement for the car.
- **Two 9V Batteries**: Power the Arduino and the motors.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect the components.
